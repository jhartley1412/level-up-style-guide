			<h3> Basic Buttons </h3>

			<p> Basic buttons are all uniform in the app. Every one has a golden outline and white center. This keeps is standard on all pages, making it easier for the children/users to learn what buttons look like, and thus letting them maneuver throughout the app faster and without confusion.
			<br> <br>
			The hover effects, only relevant on desktop, display the white with a yellow tint (same as the outline) to easily show it's accessibility.  </p>

			<h3> Icon Buttons </h3>

			<p> For the mobile, and spread throughout the tablet and desktop size app, there are unique icons; a trophy, two checklists and a user icon. The checklist icon with the pencil is for the users current Lessons; whatever lessons have been assigned to them that day. The trophy is for their badges. Badges are what children earn after going through each lesson. It gives the user a sense of accomplishment, as well as introducing gamification.
			<br> <br>
			The checklist with a checkmark is for Completed lessons. The idea is that users would be able to go back to old lessons and replay them, review them, etc. Lastly is the user icon, which is primarily used to represent signing in and out of a user's account. There is also a dropdown icon used only on the tablet layout; it opens a dropdown navigation. </p>

There's a yellow outline, but inside, only around the text, there is a light grey box. This is both to call out this text as important, as well as to shield text from background that might make it harder to read.  </p>

			<h3> What is Level Up Learning? </h3>

			<p> Level Up Learning (thanks for the name, Abby!) started out as an alternative way to teach young students in school through modern technology and gaming. Tablets are becoming a new teaching method that many school in America are trying out right now, and they're developing some pretty positive results; children learn faster when learning with a tablet. Many think that tablets will soon become a staple to any child's education in the near future.
			<br> <br>
			Level Up Learning is targeted towards kids, specifically in elementary schools, that are struggling for whatever reason in the standard lecture-worksheet method of teaching. Using a tablet, some interactive games and educational videos, a student would be able to learn about Math, Science, Social Studies and English in ways that might otherwise not be available to them in a traditional schooling. This will help children engage more in the learning process, be more likely to explore on their own, and enhance their overall educational experience. </p>

			<h3> Logo </h3>

			<p> Although the app itself is made for children, the logo is meant to sell teachers, parents and schools of it's validity. At the end of the day, it would be on schools or parents to use this app. The logo needed to be serious, but also encompass the “adventure” of the app, and the beneficial nature for education. Like the headers, the logo is Montserrat. However, to show it's playfulness, it's light, and not bolded and heavy. </p>
